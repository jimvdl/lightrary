# lightrary
A library for lights, Philips Hue lights.

## Usage 
Add the following to your `cargo.toml`:
```rust
lightrary = { git = "https://github.com/jimvdl/lightrary" }
```
The Philips Hue API is still rapidly evolving, at a rate where I can't possible keep up with its developemnt. Publishing to crates.io would just contribute to another left-behind, unmaintained crate, due to breaking changes to Philip's API. There are already numours Hue crates that have been abandoned this way and no longer work.
